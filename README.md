# Topic Modeling & Document Ranking

According to the article, [Big Data Statistics & Facts for 2017](https://waterfordtechnologies.com/big-data-interesting-facts/), "the volume of business data worldwide, across all organizations, doubles every 1.2 years". With an overwhelming amount of data available nowadays, the task of locating relevant information for a research topic may take several days, weeks, or months. This project focuses on topic extraction and document ranking to help researchers, academic professionals, and students quickly locate relevant documents for their topics while minimizing the time and effort put into the information collection and review process.

## Dataset

The dataset contains a collection of xml documents including three query topics and 333 abstracts of  scientific articles from [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) and [TREC 2017](http://www.trec-cds.org/2017.html).

 - The __topic__ contains information about a single patient suffering from a disease. A name is assigned to each topic for ease of information recall when performing data analysis.<br /><br />

    - Topic 1: __lung cancer, egfr, aged female__
