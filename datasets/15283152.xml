  <Doc_title>[The effect of imatinib for gastrointestinal tumor].</Doc_title>
  <Doc_abstract>Long-term survival in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) was very rare. Recently treatment with imatinib mesylate, a molecular targeted agent that inhibits the KIT tyrosine kinase receptor showed 81.6% of outstanding clinical response (PR 53.7%, SD 27.9%). Toxicities with daily dose of 400 mg and 600 mg, all patients had grade 1 or 2 toxicity. Grade 3 or higher toxicities occurred in 21.1% including edema, neutropenia, nausea, dermatitis, hepatitis and gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The drug was relatively safe overall.</Doc_abstract>
