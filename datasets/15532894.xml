  <Doc_title>[Imatinib--a new perspective in the treatment of tumors].</Doc_title>
  <Doc_abstract>Among novel promising approaches to anticancer therapy belongs the targeting inhibition of signal transduction. This review outlines present-day experiences with imatinib (Glivec), a potent inhibitor of the tyrosine kinases bcr-abl, c-kit and platelet-derived growth factor receptor kinase. Due to inhibition of bcr-abl tyroxine kinase, imatinib has rapidly become the standard therapy for chronic myelocytic leukemia; inhibition of c-kit receptor explains its effectivity in the treatment of patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Another known target of imatinib is tyrosine kinase of PDGFR, which is activated in numerous malignancies, particularly in dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. Discovery of the novel fusion gene in hypereosinophilic syndrome (FIPILI-PFGFRA, whose product is an imatinib sensitive protein kinase) permitted to treat successfully this event. Possible combination of imatinib with conventional chemotherapeutic drugs and other key signal transduction inhibitors are mentioned.</Doc_abstract>
