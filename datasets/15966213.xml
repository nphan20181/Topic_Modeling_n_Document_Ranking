  <Doc_title>Is imatinib justified as an adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with recurrent gastrointestinal stromal tumors.</Doc_title>
  <Doc_abstract>Imatinib, an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of c-kit, was used as an adjuvant chemotherapy in two patients who underwent curative surgery for recurrent gastrointestinal stromal tumors. One patient has maintained tumor-free survival for 12 months, while the other had rapid recurrence and metastasis of tumors 3 months after he discontinued the drug. The indication and effects of imatinib for prevention of recurrence of GIST after ablative surgery were discussed.</Doc_abstract>
