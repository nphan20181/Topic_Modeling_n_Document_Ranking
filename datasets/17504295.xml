  <Doc_title>Mutations in gastrointestinal stromal tumors--a population-based study from Northern Norway.</Doc_title>
  <Doc_abstract>Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is the most common mesenchymal tumor of the gastrointestinal tract. This tumor typically expresses KIT, and has KIT or PDGFRA activating mutation. In this study we evaluated 89 GISTs diagnosed in Northern Norway during a 30-year period. KIT exons 8, 9, 11, 13, and 17 were analyzed by PCR amplification and direct sequencing. Subsequently PDGRA exons 12, 14, and 18 were evaluated in KIT wild-type cases. KIT mutations were found in 66 cases (75%), and PDGFRA mutations in 9 cases (10%). Most common were KIT exon 11 mutations, with 58 cases. Tumors with Kit exon 11 point mutations had a significantly better prognosis than those with deletions. There were five KIT exon 9 duplications, three exon 13 point mutations, and one point mutation in exon 17. There were nine PDGFGRA mutations: seven in exon 18 and two in exon 12. All but one PDGFRA mutant GISTs were gastric tumors with epithelioid morphology, and these tumors were on average smaller than those with KIT mutations. KIT and PDGFRA wild type was found in 15% of cases. Analysis of KIT and PDGFRA mutations is of significance for treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and may also have value when assessing the biological potential of GIST.</Doc_abstract>
