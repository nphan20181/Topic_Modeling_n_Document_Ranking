  <Doc_title>New paradigms in gastrointestinal stromal tumour management.</Doc_title>
  <Doc_abstract>Targeted agents have improved the prognosis for patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs). Many patients exhibit intolerance or resistance to first-line therapy with imatinib mesylate. Sunitinib malate is approved multinationally for the treatment of advanced imatinib-refractory GIST.;This article reviews responses to imatinib and sunitinib reported in clinical trials in advanced GIST and discusses the effect of mutational status on treatment responses; therapeutic developments in GIST treatment are also reviewed.;Imatinib 400 mg/day has shown efficacy for first-line treatment of advanced GIST, particularly in patients with KIT exon 11 mutations. Sunitinib 50 mg/day (Schedule 4/2) has demonstrated effectiveness and tolerability in imatinib-refractory GIST, including patients who would be excluded from clinical trials. Sunitinib is associated with longer median overall survival in patients with primary KIT exon 9 mutations and wild-type GIST compared with KIT exon 11 mutations in a retrospective study. Ongoing studies, including imatinib in the adjuvant setting and the use of targeted agents in sequence or in combination, will further refine the therapeutic pathway for advanced GIST.;The availability of targeted therapies and greater knowledge of the effect of mutational status on patient responses will assist in optimising outcomes in advanced GIST.</Doc_abstract>
