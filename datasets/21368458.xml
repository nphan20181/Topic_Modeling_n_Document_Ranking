  <Doc_abstract>While lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, the molecular mechanism underlying its carcinogenesis is mainly unknown. We have discovered a small, fusion-type tyrosine kinase EML4-ALK that is generated through a tiny inversion within the short arm of human chromosome 2. Transgenic mice expressing EML4-ALK in lung developed hundreds of lung cancer nodules soon after birth, but such nodules were readily eradicated upon treatment with an ALK inhibitor. Clinical trials for EML4-ALK-positive lung cancer with an ALK inhibitor is ongoing, with its interim results being highly promising.</Doc_abstract>
