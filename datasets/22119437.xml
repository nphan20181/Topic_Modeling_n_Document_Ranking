  <Doc_title>EGFR-mutated oncogene-addicted non-small cell lung cancer: current trends and future prospects.</Doc_title>
  <Doc_abstract>Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumours with certain mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase have been termed 'oncogene addicted' to reflect their dependence on EGFR-mediated pro-survival signalling and their high susceptibility to apoptosis induced by EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs, e.g. gefitinib and erlotinib). The most common mutations (L858R and exon 19 deletions) predict an improved clinical response to first-line oral EGFR-TKIs compared with standard platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC. Moreover, these mutations are also prognostic of a relatively indolent course of disease, regardless of treatment, as compared with classical NSCLC. Treatment strategies for oncogene-addicted NSCLC are therefore distinct from those for non-oncogene addicted NSCLC, and will depend on the specific genetic mutation present.</Doc_abstract>
