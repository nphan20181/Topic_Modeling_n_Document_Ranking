  <Doc_title>Ceritinib for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.</Doc_title>
  <Doc_abstract>Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents the paradigm of personalized treatment in human cancer. Several oncogenic alterations with druggable potential have been identified, with ALK rearrangements representing one of the newest and most appealing. Crizotinib is now recognized as the standard of care in chemotherapy-pretreated ALK-positive NSCLC due to the positive results of a recently published trial. Unfortunately, no patient exposed to crizotinib can be cured, and after a median time of 1 year, resistance inevitably occurs. Overcoming resistance is the major challenge in clinical oncology and many molecules are currently under evaluation, including ceritinib (LDK-378). Ceritinib is an oral, potent, second-generation ALK inhibitor recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Preclinical data showed impressive antitumor activity against crizotinib-resistant clones, and based on available data, ceritinib could represent a suitable option in crizotinib-resistant NSCLC. </Doc_abstract>
