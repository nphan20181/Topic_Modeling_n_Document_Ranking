  <Doc_title>[Targeted therapies in non-small cell lung cancer in 2014].</Doc_title>
  <Doc_abstract>For several years, the identification of molecular sequencing alterations has considerably changed the perception and treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). These alterations have been defined as &quot;driver mutations&quot;, such as mutations in EGFR and EML4-ALK fusion gene, and are highly sensitive to specific therapies. Other targets have also been identified recently. Personalized medicine is now a reality for patients with advanced NSCLC on the basis of routine screening for EGFR, HER2, KRAS, BRAF, PI3KCA mutations and EML4-ALK rearrangement. This article describes identified biomarkers, available targeted therapies, and the main clinical research approaches in NSCLC. </Doc_abstract>
