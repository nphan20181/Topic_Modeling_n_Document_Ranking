  <Doc_title>[Clinical management of advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors after failure of at least both imatinib and sunitinib targeted therapy].</Doc_title>
  <Doc_abstract>The emergence of small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitors opened the era of targeted therapy of gastrointestinal stromal tumor(GIST). Survival and life of quality of patients from advanced stage are significantly improved by using targeted therapy. However, with prolonged treatment, drug resistance is becoming more and more common and directly affects the survival of patients. The current clinical management in failure of multi-line targeted therapies will be discussed in this article. </Doc_abstract>
