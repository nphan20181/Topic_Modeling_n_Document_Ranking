  <Doc_title>The EML4-ALK oncogene: targeting an essential growth driver in human cancer.</Doc_title>
  <Doc_abstract>Targeting of essential growth drivers represents an ideal approach to cancer treatment. To identify such molecules in clinical specimens, we developed a highly sensitive functional screening system based on the preparation of retroviral cDNA expression libraries. By screening such a library of lung adenocarcinoma with a focus formation assay, we discovered the EML4-ALK fusion-type oncogene. A small chromosomal inversion thus leads to fusion of the amino-terminal portion of the microtubule-associated protein EML4 to the intracellular kinase domain of ALK, a receptor-type protein tyrosine kinase. Constitutive dimerization of EML4-ALK mediated by a dimerization motif of EML4 results in kinase activation. Specific inhibitors of the kinase activity of ALK have been developed as therapeutic drugs for EML4-ALK-positive lung cancer, three of which (crizotinib, ceritinib, and alectinib) have already been approved for clinical use. An overall clinical response rate of 93.5% for alectinib has shown that agents that target essential growth drivers can become magic bullets for cancer treatment. </Doc_abstract>
