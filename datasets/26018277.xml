  <Doc_title>[Therapeutic effects of crizotinib in EML4-ALK-positive patients with non-small-cell lung cancer].</Doc_title>
  <Doc_abstract>To evaluate the therapeutic effects of different therapeutic regimens for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with or without EML4-ALK rearrangement.;Twenty-one ALK-positive and 50 ALK-negative NSCLC patients who received voluntarily EML4-ALK testing and 75 NSCLC patients without AL testing were enrolled in this study. The 3 groups of patients received different treatments, and the therapeutic effects, progression-free survival (PFS), and treatment-related adverse events were analyzed.;Crizotinib treatment obviously prolonged the PFS in EML4-ALK-positive patients with an objective response rate (OOR) of 61.9% and a median response duration of 16 months, which were significantly better than those in with ALK-negative patients and patients without ALK testing who received different second-line therapies.;Crizotinib is superior to platinum-based chemotherapy in NSCLC patients with ALK rearrangement. ALK rearrangement id not a modifier of the effect of chemotherapy regimens in NSCLC patients.</Doc_abstract>
