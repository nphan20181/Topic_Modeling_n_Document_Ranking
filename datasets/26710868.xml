  <Doc_title>[Mutations of EGFR gene and EML4-ALK fusion gene in superficial lymph node of non-small cell lung cancer].</Doc_title>
  <Doc_abstract>To explore the mutation status of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) fusion gene and microtubule associated protein like 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML4-ALK) fusion gene in superficial lymph nodes of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).;The technique of fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction (FQ-PCR) was employed for detecting the mutation rate of EGFR gene and EML4-ALK fusion gene for 40 cases of superficial lymph node tissue of NSCLC inpatients at General Military Hospital of Beijing PLA Command from February 2013 to November 2014. And then the correlations were analyzed between EMIA-ALK fusion gene and EGFR gene with clinical features and the clinical efficacies of targeted therapy.;The mutation rate of EGFR gene was 35% (14/40) and 50% (10/20) in non-smokers and 46.7% (14/30) in adenocarcinoma patients. The mutation distribution was as follows: exon 18 (n = 1), exon 19 (n =8) and exon 21 (n =5). The mutation rate of EML4-ALK fusion gene was 2. 5% (1/40). EGFR gene mutation was predominantly present in non-smokers (P &lt; 0. 05) and adenocarcinoma (P &lt;0. 01) while no significant difference existed between gender, age or stage (P &gt;0. 05). Those on a targeted therapy had a disease control rate of 93. 3%.;Both EGFR gene and EMI4-ALK fusion gene may be detected in superficial lymph nodes of NSCLC patients. The mutation rate of EGFR gene is high in adenocarcinoma and non-smokers while EML4-ALK fusion gene has a low mutation rate.</Doc_abstract>
