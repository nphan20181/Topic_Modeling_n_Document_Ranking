  <Doc_title>Establishment of a conditional transgenic mouse model recapitulating EML4-ALK-positive human non-small cell lung cancer.</Doc_title>
  <Doc_abstract>ALK fusion is a distinct molecular subclassification of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that is targeted by ALK inhibitors. We established a transgenic mouse model that expresses tumors highly resembling human NSCLC harboring EML-ALK fusion. We aimed to test EML4-ALK transgenic mouse model as a platform for assessing efficacy of ALK inhibitor and examining mechanisms of acquired resistance to ALK inhibitor.;Transgenic mouse lines harboring LoxP-STOP-LoxP- FLAG tagged human EML4-ALK (variant 1) transgene was established using C57BL/6N mice. The transgenic mouse model with highly lung-specific, inducible expression of EML4-ALK fusion protein was established by crossing the EML4-ALK transgenic mice with mice expressing Cre-estrogen receptor (Cre-ER</Doc_abstract>
